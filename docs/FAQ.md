## FAQ

---

### 1. Why all the data is [stored in YAML tokens](https://github.com/sbsrnt/poe-watch/tree/main/tokens) and not in a database?
I don't have time to deal with additional codebase, maintenance and costs of a backend services.

### 2. Why [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/) for gifs / videos?
Pretty much Plug-n-Play for `Windows`. 

1. You download the client.
2. Set keybind to capture the video+gif. 
3. Once captured it automatically uploads to the cloud.
4. Trimming takes seconds. 
   
Also the client is [open source](https://github.com/gyazo/). How cool is that?
