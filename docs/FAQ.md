### 1. Why [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/) for gifs / videos?
Pretty much Plug-n-Play for Windows. You download the client. Set keybind to capture the video+gif. Once captured it automatically uploads to the cloud. Trimming takes one click. Also the client is [open source](https://github.com/gyazo/). How cool is that?
